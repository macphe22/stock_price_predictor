This repository is for a class project at Michigan State University studying big data analytics.  

We are using the different techniques we have learned throughout the course of the semester to collect raw data, do necessary pre-processing steps, perform
some form of machine learning algorithm on the data set, and analyze the results.  

This project involves gathering both raw historic Twitter data as well as collecting real time Twitter Data for 5 big tech companies.  We also 
collected data for the companies corresponding stock price for those days.  We further analyzed the sentiment of those tweets to analyze if they 
had an effect on the stock price or not.
